# English-to-French-Translation-LSTM-NLP

This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for translating English text to French. The model is trained on a dataset of English-French sentence pairs and aims to provide accurate translations.

## Project Overview

The main components of this project include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization and padding of sentences to prepare the data for the LSTM model.
- **Model Architecture**: Building and training an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for translation.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring the performance of the model using BLEU scores and other relevant metrics.
- **Inference**: Translating new English sentences into French using the trained model.
